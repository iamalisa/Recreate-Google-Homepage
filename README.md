# Recreate-Google-Homepage

Hello! 

The first assignment I've completed for this course was to recreate the Google homepage. I initially thought it would be quite simple, but in actuality I struggled a lot with the CSS. There are things that I could still fix, but overall I am happy with how it turned out. I learned a lot from doing this, and I'm sure it'll become easier for me as time goes on!
